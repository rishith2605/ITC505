    <h2>Addendum: Process, Creative Choices, and Challenges</h2>
    <p>For this project, I wanted to design and develop a webpage for “The Trials of Eldoria,” a fantasy adventure web story for today’s audiences with help of modern techniques. I decided on warm colors and used brown and gold as the base while selecting the medieval theme; ‘Cinzel’ and ‘Lora’ fonts were chosen as elegant and easy to read. That is one of the reasons why for the layout I used Flexbox which made buttons always align properly regardless of the screen size, the problem of media query compatibility with different devices. I also improved button hover effects and tested the page across devices to check if it operates well. This project also enhanced my knowledge of the responsiveness, typography, and the impact that small changes make in an interface.</p>
