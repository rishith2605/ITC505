        <h2>SCENE III. A park near the palace.</h2>
        <p>Enter three Murderers</p>
        <p><strong>First Murderer</strong><br>But who did bid thee join with us?</p>
        <p><strong>Third Murderer</strong><br>Macbeth.</p>
        <p><strong>Second Murderer</strong><br>He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers<br>
        Our offices and what we have to do<br>
        To the direction just.</p>
        <p><strong>First Murderer</strong><br>Then stand with us.<br>
        The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:<br>
        Now spurs the lated traveller apace<br>
        To gain the timely inn; and near approaches<br>
        The subject of our watch.</p>
        <p><strong>Third Murderer</strong><br>Hark! I hear horses.</p>
        <p><strong>BANQUO</strong><br>[Within] Give us a light there, ho!</p>
        <p><strong>Second Murderer</strong><br>Then 'tis he: the rest<br>
        That are within the note of expectation<br>
        Already are i' the court.</p>
        <p><strong>First Murderer</strong><br>His horses go about.</p>
        <p><strong>Third Murderer</strong><br>Almost a mile: but he does usually,<br>
        So all men do, from hence to the palace gate<br>
        Make it their walk.</p>
        <p><strong>Second Murderer</strong><br>A light, a light!</p>
        <p>Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch</p>
        <p><strong>Third Murderer</strong><br>'Tis he.</p>
        <p><strong>First Murderer</strong><br>Stand to't.</p>
        <p><strong>BANQUO</strong><br>It will be rain to-night.</p>
        <p><strong>First Murderer</strong><br>Let it come down.</p>
        <p>They set upon BANQUO</p>
        <p><strong>BANQUO</strong><br>O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!<br>
        Thou mayst revenge. O slave!</p>
        <p>Dies. FLEANCE escapes</p>
        <p><strong>Third Murderer</strong><br>Who did strike out the light?</p>
        <p><strong>First Murderer</strong><br>Wast not the way?</p>
        <p><strong>Third Murderer</strong><br>There's but one down; the son is fled.</p>
        <p><strong>Second Murderer</strong><br>We have lost<br>
        Best half of our affair.</p>
        <p><strong>First Murderer</strong><br>Well, let's away, and say how much is done.</p>
